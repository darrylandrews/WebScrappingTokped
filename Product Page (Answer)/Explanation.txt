ANSWER:

The product.py program takes in a product page url and extracts several key data, such as:
	- Product Name
	- Seller
	- Main Category
	- Sub Category
	- Category
	- Price
	- Sold
	- Rating
	- Total Rating
	- Link

Example user input: 'https://www.tokopedia.com/ptpratamasemesta/iphone-13-garansi-resmi-128gb-biru?extParam=ivf%3Dfalse&src=topads'

The extracted data are then appended into the product.csv file and product.json file. 
Each time a user enters a product page, the csv and json file will be updated as well.

Several Libraries used:
	- Selenium (must be ver.4 and above)
	- BeautifulSoup44
	- Pandas

Before running the program, there are several things that must be updated:
	1. chromedriver
		=> download chromedriver based on the user's current google chrome version 
		=> to check google chrome version (Settings > About Chrome > Version) 
		=> the chrome driver in the folder is ver. 103.0.5060.134
		=> download link: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

	2. User-agent
		=> to update the user-agent please open the product.py file in any python code editor and change the use-agent manually
		=> the code is on the very top of the code at opsi.add_argument("user-agent = <Enter user-agent>")
		=> check user agent at: https://www.whatismybrowser.com/detect/what-is-my-user-agent/

Thank you.

ALTERNATE ANSWER:

The tokopedia.py program takes in a product name or category and extracts several key data from 80 search result, such as:
	- Product Name
	- Seller
	- Location
	- Price
	- Sold
	- Rating
	- Link

Example of user input: 'Iphone 13' or 'Buku Kimia'

The extracted data are then dumped into the csv and json folder. 
Each time a user enters a product name or category, a new csv and json file will be made in their respective folders.

Several Libraries used:
	- Selenium (must be ver.4 and above)
	- BeautifulSoup44
	- Pandas

Before running the program, there are several things that must be updated:
	1. chromedriver
		=> download chromedriver based on the user's current google chrome version 
		=> to check google chrome version (Settings > About Chrome > Version) 
		=> the chrome driver in the folder is ver. 103.0.5060.134
		=> download link: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

	2. User-agent
		=> to update the user-agent please open the product.py file in any python code editor and change the use-agent manually
		=> the code is on the very top of the code at opsi.add_argument("user-agent = <Enter user-agent>")
		=> check user agent at: https://www.whatismybrowser.com/detect/what-is-my-user-agent/

Thank you.
